# Api Overview

The documentation for the api of the library contains mainly three part:

- External API, with documentation.
- Internal implementation, usually no documentation and only source code.
- Error handling.

[`Option`](./option.md) and [`Result`](./result.md) are the basic tool for using monads in Python.

[STD Types](./std_types.md) are wrappers around basic Python collections.

[Advanced iterator](./iterator_tools.md) contains an advanced iterator, offering chained expressions and results.
